## Microsoft-malmo Docker image for Deep Learning

Here are Dockerfile to get you up and running with a fully functional [Microsoft-malmo](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo) installation. 

Here are a [Vid√©o demo](https://youtu.be/vtT4wyiR2Uo) link . 

## Setup
Install [Artificial Intelligence made easy for all](https://github.com/berlius/artificial-intelligence) following the installation guide.

You have 2 options to obtain the Docker image
#### Option 1 : Download the Docker image from Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a cloud based repository of pre-built images. You can download the image directly from here, which should be _much faster_ than building it locally (a few minutes, based on your internet speed).

**GPU Version**
```bash
docker pull berlius/microsoft-malmo:gpu
```

#### Option 2 : Build the Docker image locally 

### GPU version

2. Build the Docker image locally : 

```
git clone https://github.com/berlius/DeepLearningDockerfile
cd DeepLearningDockerfile/Microsoft-malmo

sudo docker build -t berlius/microsoft-malmo:gpu -f Dockerfile .
```

## Running the Docker image as a Container
```
sudo nvidia-docker-plugin

xhost + ; sudo nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -p 8000:8000 -v `pwd`:/root/sharedfolder -v /mnt/sda4:/root/sda4 --privileged --device=/dev/snd:/dev/snd -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY berlius/artificial-intelligence-gpu lxterminal
```
In "lxterminal" :

```
cd sharedfolder

wget https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/releases/download/0.15.0/Malmo-0.15.0-Linux-Ubuntu-14.04-64bit.zip

unzip Malmo-0.15.0-Linux-Ubuntu-14.04-64bit.zip

cd Malmo-0.15.0-Linux-Ubuntu-14.04-64bit/Minecraft

./launchClient.sh

```
Note `wget` et `unzip` is required for the first installation only.

Note the use of `nvidia-docker` rather than just `docker`

| Parameter      | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
|`-it`             | This creates an interactive terminal you can use to iteract with your container |
|`-p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -p 8000:8000`    | This exposes the ports inside the container so they can be accessed from the host. The format is `-p <host-port>:<container-port>`. The default iPython Notebook runs on port 8888 and Tensorboard on 6006 |
|`-v /sharedfolder:/root/sharedfolder/` | This shares the folder `/sharedfolder` on your host machine to `/root/sharedfolder/` inside your container. Any data written to this folder by the container will be persistent. You can modify this to anything of the format `-v /local/shared/folder:/shared/folder/in/container/`. See [Docker container persistence](#docker-container-persistence)
|`berlius/microsoft-malmo:gpu`   | This the image that you want to run. The format is `image:tag`. In our case, we use the image `microsoft-malmo` and tag `gpu` |
|`bash`       | This provides the default command when the container is started. Even if this was not provided, bash is the default command and just starts a Bash session. You can modify this to be whatever you'd like to be executed when your container starts. For example, you can execute `xhost + ; sudo nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -p 8000:8000 -v `pwd`:/root/sharedfolder -v /mnt/sda4:/root/sda4 --privileged --device=/dev/snd:/dev/snd -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY berlius/artificial-intelligence-gpu jupyter notebook`. This will execute the command `jupyter notebook` and starts your Jupyter Notebook for you when the container starts

## Some common scenarios
### Jupyter Notebooks
The container comes pre-installed with iPython and iTorch Notebooks, and you can use these to work with the deep learning frameworks. If you spin up the docker container with `docker-run -p <host-port>:<container-port>` (as shown above in the [instructions](#running-the-docker-image-as-a-container)), you will have access to these ports on your host and can access them at `http://127.0.0.1:<host-port>`. The default iPython notebook uses port 8888 and Tensorboard uses port 6006. Since we expose both these ports when we run the container, we can access them both from the localhost.

However, you still need to start the Notebook inside the container to be able to access it from the host. You can either do this from the container terminal by executing `jupyter notebook` or you can pass this command in directly while spinning up your container using the `xhost + ; sudo nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -p 8000:8000 -v `pwd`:/root/sharedfolder -v /mnt/sda4:/root/sda4 --privileged --device=/dev/snd:/dev/snd -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY berlius/artificial-intelligence-gpu jupyter notebook` CLI. The Jupyter Notebook has both Python (for TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano, Keras, Lasagne) and iTorch (for Torch) kernels.

### Data Sharing
See [Docker container persistence](#docker-container-persistence). 
Consider this: You have a script that you've written on your host machine. You want to run this in the container and get the output data (say, a trained model) back into your host. The way to do this is using a [Shared Volumne](#docker-container-persistence). By passing in the `-v /sharedfolder/:/root/sharedfolder` to the CLI, we are sharing the folder between the host and the container, with persistence. You could copy your script into `/sharedfolder` folder on the host, execute your script from inside the container (located at `/root/sharedfolder`) and write the results data back to the same folder. This data will be accessible even after you kill the container.

## What is Docker?
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) itself has a great answer to this question.

Docker is based on the idea that one can package code along with its dependencies into a self-contained unit. In this case, we start with a base Ubuntu 14.04 image, a bare minimum OS. When we build our initial Docker image using `docker build`, we install all the deep learning frameworks and its dependencies on the base, as defined by the `Dockerfile`. This gives us an image which has all the packages we need installed in it. We can now spin up as many instances of this image as we like, using the `docker run` command. Each instance is called a _container_. Each of these containers can be thought of as a fully functional and isolated OS with all the deep learning libraries installed in it. 

## FAQs
### Performance
Running the project as Docker containers should have no performance impact during runtime. Spinning up a Docker container itself is very fast and should take only a couple of seconds or less

### Docker container persistence
Keep in mind that the changes made inside Docker container are not persistent. Lets say you spun up a Docker container, added and deleted a few files and then kill the container. The next time you spin up a container using the same image, all your previous changes will be lost and you will be presented with a fresh instance of the image. This is great, because if you mess up your container, you can always kill it and start afresh again. It's bad if you don't know/understand this and forget to save your work before killing the container. There are a couple of ways to work around this:

1. **Commit**: If you make changes to the image itself (say, install a few new libraries), you can commit the changes and settings into a new image. Note that this will create a new image, which will take a few GBs space on your disk. In your next session, you can create a container from this new image. For details on commit, see [Docker's documentaion](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/).

2. **Shared volume**: If you don't make changes to the image itself, but only create data (say, train a new Caffe model), then commiting the image each time is an overkill. In this case, it is easier to persist the data changes to a folder on your host OS using shared volumes. Simple put, the way this works is you share a folder from your host into the container. Any changes made to the contents of this folder from inside the container will persist, even after the container is killed. For more details, see Docker's docs on [Managing data in containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/)
 
### What operating systems are supported?
Docker is supported on all the OSes mentioned here: [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (i.e. different flavors of Linux, Windows and OS X). If the project as a CPU parameter then the Dockerfile will run on all the above operating systems. However, the GPU parameter will only run on Linux OS. This is because Docker runs inside a virtual machine on Windows and OS X. Virtual machines don't have direct access to the GPU on the host. Unless PCI passthrough is implemented for these hosts, GPU support isn't available on non-Linux OSes at the moment.
